    "# Liveability (Mmax) and survivable but not liveable matrix tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will introduce you in the estimation of liveability matrices replicating graphs 4, S6, or S7 for maximum internal heat production (`Mmax`) and survivable but not liveable conditions (`survive_but_not_livable`) in Vanos et al. (2023). For this exercise, we are taking possible humidity values for temperatures between 25 and 60°C. Notice that radiation and wind are fixed here. Therefore, if your analysis has the same considerations, you could use these matrices as look-up tables. Otherwise, you will need to run the algorithm for each environmental condition and person setup. This analysis is intended for time frames that match global climate models with a temporal resolution of 3 and 6 hours once a sustained exposure is one of the steady-state model assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How is the maximum internal heat production (Mmax) defined as a liveability metric?**\n",
    "`Mmax` is the maximum internal heat production, or level of physical activity, that a person can generate without a sustained positive rate of heat storage in the prevailing environment, thus allowing safe, sustained work and play for an extended period. This is an instantaneous metric on time and it is not related to a exposure duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of liveability analysis, survivable but not liveable conditions `survive_but_not_livable`, in which people cannot increase their activity without continuously storing heat inside the body, which will lead to a continuous in core temperature, but heat stroke death after a 3-hour exposure would not occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimers**: \n",
    "\n",
    "-In this analysis, to set the upper limit for survivable but not liveable conditions, we are using the survivability limit for a 3H exposure. That does not mean 3 hour is the duration for the safe, sustained activity that `Mmax` represent. `Mmax` is a threshold for the magnitude of internal heat production to keep the body upon compensable heat stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Mmax`values are capped at 10 METs to reflect a reasonable upper limit of sustainable activity intensity for a healthy adult under thermal comfort or cold stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "- Range of temperatures and humidity\n",
    "- Type of humidity metric\n",
    "- Personal profile description\n",
    "- Matrix of wet bulb temperature (Tw) (This is only for comparison purposes with Tw=35°C)\n",
    "- Survivability matrix (in this case, 3H exposure is used)\n",
    "- Flag survivability that indicates the survivability type according to the physiological constraints imposed in this model (in this case, 3H exposure is used).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "- **Liveability matrix (Mmax)**: Maximum metabolic rate to keep compensable heat stress (METs) (i.e., that a person can generate without a sustained positive rate of heat storage even with a maximal thermoregulatory response)\n",
    "- **Survivable but not liveable matrix**: Flag that indicates if a person even upon uncompensable heat stress but if resting (minimal physical activity) can survive.\n",
    "- **Plot of liveability estimates based on Mmax**, indicating too those conditions that are survivable but not livable, Survivability limit to 3H exposure and Tw=35 limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain more details regarding the rationale behind these methods,look for session \"methods\" and their detail in the supplemental material in Vanos et al.(2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice you need to change manually what type of humidity metric you want in the y-axis when indicated in the code with the `variable` version. You can choose between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- rh: Relative humidity (%) \n",
    "- wv: Water vapor pressure (mmHg)\n",
    "- q: Specific humidity (g/kg)\n",
