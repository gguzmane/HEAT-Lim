This repository includes the codes to apply a human-environment heat exchange model for different heat stress research questions. The codes here are focused on a  Survivability and Livability model due to heat stress based on Partitional Calorimetry.

This repository include the codes applied in the analysis for the publication: (Vanos et al., 2023. In prep) A physiological approach for assessing human survivability and liveability to heat in a changing climate.
